# ECEC_622
This repository keeps track of my assignments for ECEC 622: Parallel Programming course at Drexel University. Course Description is provided below:
This course will focus on developing parallel algorithms for multi-core CPUs using: (1) OpenMP, a progamming interface for shared-memory parallel computers, (2) streaming SIMD extensions (SSE2), and (3) the pthread multi-threading library. The course will also teach students how to develop parallel algorithms for the graphics processing unit (GPU) and implement them using the CUDA programming interface. Specifically, students will be introduced to the architecture of a modern GPU, to the CUDA programming interface, and to general purpose programming on the GPU.
